# Purpose
* I originally wanted to make a music visualizer in C++, which would require the use of libraries such as openGL, or libsndfile. At the time of writing, I lack the knowledge to use C++ dependency management. I will use this repository to record what I have learned about makefiles and cmake.

# Extra Info
* CMake tutorial I followed when making this repository: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlKcXPUJGwA
